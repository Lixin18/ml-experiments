# ml-experiments

this is truly for machine learning experiments from the basic to the pro
the first step is to learn python 
the next is to learn exploratory data analysis and its concepts
the next step is to build basic ML proects in python language 
using google colab is an good option 
then we will be learning to do advanced projects in ML \
then learn cnn and rnn and work with that'
then learn deep learning and generative AI
